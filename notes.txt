** to do first:
- in jquery-comments, clicking on replied message arrow should highlight the parent comment!
- make academic question similar to discuss question(also enable disliking answers)
- in item listing form, update FCFA with user's country's currency
(create util function to get currency of country)
- change full name validator (frontend nd backend)
- enable unique username (collation)
- redirect to previous page upon logout


** TO DO:
- on ckeditor page, when image is about to uploaded, clicking on "Browse server" opens a new window to the admin page. Prevent this.
- create another thumbnail alias for small photos. this one will be used with small photos such that their size doesn't add. 
ex. in the current implementation, a photo with resolution(200 x 80) will generate a thumbnail with higher resolution and hence heavier. 
Use a thumbnail alias 'small_photo_thumb' and perform a size check during photo upload, perhaps from 1MB and below should use this alias,
better still check the width and height of the image... (maybe sum of W and H)
- when user is logged in, reduce size of notifs and my account section on mobile.
- validate uploaded past paper file type
- jquery blockUI: https://jquery.malsup.com/block/


- change text in toast after bookmarking social profile 
- change follow/unfollow text after question is followed or unfollowed(without needing to refresh page).
- update taggit-selectize. should not call backend upon typing every letter!!
- after uploading image in listing pages, there should be an eye icon on it. 
upon which clicking should enlarge the image...
- restrict length of text fields... (also in models; eg via clean method)
- add through models (follow, bookmark, upvote, downvote) then add datetime fields
so as to keep track of when these actions are done
- if user is authed, on header, change profile icon to his profile image. 
- add attractive and pleasant modal when new users visit the site(homepage) for their first time.
- verify on frontend that required contact-number field has been entered, before submitting form
- add a page in the site to explain how non-univ students can use it ...?
- on social profile create form, interested relationship should be multiple select (multiple values should be permitted).
(updaet models, displaying & filtering accordingly)
- in listing update and creation forms, first verify via js that contact numbers count is ok. also, if form contains errors, move page to the error section... 
- count number of downloads for past paper(download_count field) .. ajax on download button click
- editing and creating a new item(that supports photos) pollutes the photos. (since session uses same key for updates and creations) (i don't think it's a big problem lol)
- add google attribution template var(should_attribute) to context via view so as to limit reduce code, etc... 
- enable translation for question tags, past paper comments(change model and translation.py too) and comments in qa_site
- screen overlay or loading stuff when ajax request is called (e.g. when a thread is voted)
highlight each occurrence of keywords in search results page.
- add following questions on profile-qa page.. when user follows a question, the displayed toast should link to this page
on question detail page, enable ordering answers (by date posted, votes, etc..)
on listing pages, enable ordering (by date too..)
- use font awesome latest version(6.1.1) and properly install https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/python-django
- check if past paper is unique upon posting... ? if possible .
- cached property (with ttl) package is a must ! especially for complex computations.(in future)
- use ajax for username select ... 
- on dashboard page, hide site points/or amount made and display only on click
- update dashboard page. is concept of points still valid ?
- username mentions in comments (questions)
- validate birth date (year) in social profile; user should be above 15 ... ?. eg.ages below 15 should be rejected.. ??
- display "some users" aside on mobile too.
- in institution select menu, for each institution, get questions, items, adverts,past papers etc.. for that institution upon clicking.
- after 24hrs, votes can't be recalled.
- change the flag alert div to a toast. (create custom info toast...)
- add repost(relist) button near posts older than x days.
(to implement this, we can delete the previous post then create the new post...)
(or redirect user to update page then add a field last_reposted_on ... idk)
- num of characters limit control, ckeditor, comments, questions, etc..
- remove duration from listings for now right... perhaps implement in future. yep.
- you can also add the field expiry_datetime to each post (listing) then when saving, set this field to creation_datetime + ... (in short see how it's implemented in lost_or_found models.)
- insert anchor links on each answer in question detail view so user(owner ?) can easily go to a given answer.
- show best users on both pc and mobile; display vertically on mobile.
- vip post(payment), birth day wish (pple with similar birthdays...); more points for answers to vip questions 
- remove empty p tags from ck editor submitted texts.
- try to set default for slug field in admin 
- checkout bootstrap form validation (especially for ckeditor fields.) - .invalid-feedback, etc..
- make the element a[name='top'] have a class and attach an event to it so it should be usable  through out the site
- create some examples (e.g. example of a good question with title body etc..) so students will have an idea of how to create theirs.
- add explanation of how to ask good question...
- add sorting by price and date in item listing page like jumia and myschool


- test with codecov(codecoverage)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21941503/django-delete-unused-media-files
jquery validation plugin..

- eventually students projects. support for ranking too


##redirect to next url.. ; use in class based views.  ###
def get_success_url(self):
	try:
		next = self.request.GET['next']
	except KeyError:
		next = self.success_url
	return next


django-anymail, django-mailer,



on post description, user shouldnt put contact details nor now web links (scam, spam, etc..)
In fact, remove all weblinks from source b4 adding to db..

Item categories example:
categories: video games & consoles, toys & hobbies, sporting goods, musical instruments & gear, jewelry & watches,
		health & beauty,dvds & movies, crafts, dolls, computers;electronics/tablets & networking, cell phones & accessories,
		books,baby,produits Apple
#
		livres, films, jouets;instruments de musique;sport & fitness;bijoux & montres;female clothes, male clothes,
		female shoes,male shoes,maisons a louer,studios & chambres a louer;motos & velos;mobiles & smartphones

Ad categories exampl:
 - job offer, event(e.g. match tomorrow..), internship, 

this site vs jumia:
	- concept of points so as to encourage sellers to signal the site that the item has being bought
		- a certain num of points => a certain privilege e.g. be moderator?(nope..), contact developers,...
		- item sold => +x points to buyer and + y points to seller (x >y)
	- form signed upon item purchase which will serve as a receipt...  (future)
	- users can only perform transaction in  items in univ, hence more security...
