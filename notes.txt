** to do first:
- update views (including home page) to consider country in session
- in item listing form, update FCFA with user's country's currency
(create util function to get currency of country)
- change full name validator (frontend nd backend)
- enable unique username (collation)
- use font awesome latest version(6.1.1) and properly install thttps://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/python-django
- remove google translation
- try to remove category field from ItemListing. 

** TO DO:
- on ckeditor page, when image is about to uploaded, clicking on "Browse server" opens a new window to the admin page. Prevent this.
- create another thumbnail alias for small photos. this one will be used with small photos such that their size doesn't add. ex. in the current implementation, a photo with resolution(200 x 80) will generate a thumbnail with higher resolution and hence heavier. Use a thumbnail alias 'small_photo_thumb' and perform a size check during photo upload, perhaps from 1MB and below should use this alias, better still check the width and height of the image... (maybe sum of W and H)
- when user is logged in, reduce size of notifs and my account section on mobile.
- validate uploaded past paper file type
- test adding image via ckeditor 
- arrange 'upload past paper button' when on mobile (see detail view.). others too like question detail ...

freeprivacypolicy.com  (cool)

- change text in toast after bookmarking social profile 
- after uploading image, there should be an eye icon on it. upon which clicking should 
enlarge the image...
- in listing update and creation forms, first verify via js that contact numbers count is ok. also, if form contains errors, move page to the error section... 
- get thumbnail of past paper pdf file. can easy_thumbnails do this... 
- count number of downloads for past paper(download_count field) .. ajax on download button click
- editing and creating a new item(that supports photos) pollutes the photos. (since session uses same key for updates and creations) (i don't think it's a big problem lol)
- for watermark, if text(Camerschools.com) is too long (if image is not wide enough to contain text), insert either just Camerschools or logo..
 - add google attribution template var(should_attribute) to context via view so as to limit reduce code, etc... 
- enable translation for question tags, past paper comments(change model and translation.py too) and comments in qa_site
- screen overlay or loading stuff when ajax request is called (e.g. when a thread is voted)
highlight each occurrence of keywords in search results page.
- add following questions on profile-qa page.. when user follows a question, the displayed toast should link to this page
on question detail page, enable ordering answers (by date posted, votes, etc..)
on listing pages, enable ordering (by date too..)
- check if past paper is unique upon posting... ? if possible .
- cached property (with ttl) package is a must ! especially for complex computations.(in future)
- use ajax for username select ... 
- on dashboard page, hide site points/or amount made and display only on click
- username mentions in comments (questions)
- validate birth date (year) in social profile; user should be above 15 ... ?. eg.ages below 15 should be rejected.. ??
- display "some users" aside on mobile too.
- in institution select menu, for each institution, get questions, items, adverts,past papers etc.. for that institution upon clicking.
- student's projects app. do this one before actual launching..
section of site where users can ask site related questions
- after 24hrs, votes can't be recalled.
- change the flag alert div to a toast. (create custom info toast...)
- add repost(relist) button near posts older than x days.
- num of characters limit control, ckeditor, comments, questions, etc..
- don't show all comments of a post(question or answer) initially. create a button `View comments(12)` that upon clicking, will display the comments of the post. then change to hide comments..which upon clicking again hides the comments. this can surely be done using bootstrap; see example in past papers list view, levels.
- if user is authed, on header, change profile icon to his profile image. 
- remove duration from listings for now right... perhaps implement in future. yep.
- you can also add the field expiry_datetime to each post (listing) then when saving, set this field to creation_datetime + ... (in short see how it's implemented in lost_or_found models.)
- insert anchor links on each answer in question detail view so user(owner ?) can easily go to a given answer.
- show best users on both pc and mobile; display vertically on mobile.

- vip post(payment), birth day wish (pple with similar birthdays...); more points for answers to vip questions 
- remove empty p tags from ck editor submitted texts.
- try to set default for slug field in admin 
- checkout bootstrap form validation (especially for ckeditor fields.) - .invalid-feedback, etc..
-show loading icon during ajax request -django
- make the element a[name='top'] have a class and attach an event to it so it should be usable  through out the site
- create some examples (e.g. example of a good question with title body etc..) so students will have an idea of how to create theirs.
- show help videos; e.g. how to add an image in ckedifor widget
- add 'draft your question advice' like stackoverflow in question creation form... ?
- add sorting by price and date  in item listing page like jumia and myschool


- infinite scroll on mobile only in item listing page like jumia. use https://stackoverflow.com/a/45717542/10526469 pagination on mobile ?... .. bootstrap position fixed bar..
	. if i.is_lastnumber_in_list and i < total_num_pages;
		generate new pagination menu with i placed first and set i as active.
		followed by next items.
	(drop infinite scroll if too difficult or time contrained.)
yaiero/tagify for tags.... 	stackoverflow.com/q/10839570/10526469
- in listing detail page, print price in words on hover over.(tooltip. see num2words library)


- test with codecov(codecoverage)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21941503/django-delete-unused-media-files
jquery validation plugin..

- eventually students projects. support for ranking too


##redirect to next url.. ; use in class based views.  ###
def get_success_url(self):
	try:
		next = self.request.GET['next']
	except KeyError:
		next = self.success_url
	return next


django-anymail, django-mailer,



on post description, user shouldnt put contact details nor now web links (scam, spam, etc..)
In fact, remove all weblinks from source b4 adding to db..

Item categories example:
categories: video games & consoles, toys & hobbies, sporting goods, musical instruments & gear, jewelry & watches,
		health & beauty,dvds & movies, crafts, dolls, computers;electronics/tablets & networking, cell phones & accessories,
		books,baby,produits Apple
#
		livres, films, jouets;instruments de musique;sport & fitness;bijoux & montres;female clothes, male clothes,
		female shoes,male shoes,maisons a louer,studios & chambres a louer;motos & velos;mobiles & smartphones

Ad categories exampl:
 - job offer, event(e.g. match tomorrow..), internship, 

this site vs jumia:
	- concept of points so as to encourage sellers to signal the site that the item has being bought
		- a certain num of points => a certain privilege e.g. be moderator?(nope..), contact developers,...
		- item sold => +x points to buyer and + y points to seller (x >y)
	- form signed upon item purchase which will serve as a receipt...  (future)
	- users can only perform transaction in  items in univ, hence more security...
